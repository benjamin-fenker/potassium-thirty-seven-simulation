1. Finnish the implementation of Holstein Event
	- The Abstract Base Class  structure is already there to accept the
	  Holstein Events
	- The Physics is the main difficulty to implement 

2. Increase the use of histograms. 
	- With the increased avaliablity of histograms it might be useful to strip out 
	  lots of the file i/o to make the code clearer or at least set up 
	  functions and flags to turn it off. 

3. Scriptability 
	- I have given up on being able to use scripts to control batch jobs.
	  The built in facility for doing this seg faults every time. I could 
	  rewrite the scripting utility to use a much simpler interface that 
	  would take a file redirected from the OS as inut but this just seems 
	  like a big time sink with not that much benifit. 

4. Geometry 
	- Implement the shake-off electron detector properly and put in the 
	  recoil ion detector. 

5. Particles 
	- Right now the only Ar species that is being produced is Ar^1-. 
	  What we should realy do is implement a scheme for producing 
	  a charge state distribution that matchs measurments.

	  UPDATE:
	  As of Dec 1 2011 I have a c++ class that will choose a charge state
	  according to the percent yields that I supply to it. I am currently
	  trying to find what the yields actually are. I am going to try 
	  an migrate my module into the K37 source code. 
	  
6. Timing 
	- When the Ar is implemented it would be nice to implement a timing signal
	  for the different charge states as they hit the recoil detector.
