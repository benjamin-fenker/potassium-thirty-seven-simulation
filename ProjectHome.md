This software is intended to be used to test the response of detectors and the sensitivity of the experimental setup to the Standard Model quantity A{beta} with trapped 37K. Its scope is very narrow and is only intended for this particular use. The application depends on software developed by Members of the [Geant4 Collaboration](http://cern.ch/geant4) and cannot be built without it.

Over time the complexity of the simulation has grown so much that it has become necessary to start some automatic way to keep track of the different simulations that had been run so as to avoid duplicating effort. For this task we are starting to serialize run parameters as JSON and save them in a database. The JSON serialization is done using the [rapidjson](https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson) library because of its ease of use and permissive licence.
